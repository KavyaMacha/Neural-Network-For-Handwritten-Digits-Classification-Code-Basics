# Neural-Network-For-Handwritten-Digits-Classification-Code-Basics
This project involves creating a neural network to recognize handwritten digits. Using a dataset like MNIST, the network learns to classify digits by analyzing their pixel values. Through training, the network adjusts its parameters to improve accuracy. Once trained, it accurately identifies digits in new images.
